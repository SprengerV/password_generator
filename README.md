This project sets to create a password generator that generates random passwords within parameters set forth by the end user. These parameters include password length and whether or not the password is to contain lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters. After selecting the parameters for their password, the user is able to press a button and have a randomly generated password of 8-128 characters in length alert onscreen. The application also makes sure that users have chosen at least one of the available character types before creating a password. Users determine the length of their randomly generated password using a silder, with a minimum value of 8 and maximum of 128.
